I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania under supervision of Prof. Eugene Mele. My main research interests include topological states of matter and quantum geometry in low-dimensional materials. I am especially interested in transport signatures of quantum geometry in moiré and other artifical superlattices.
